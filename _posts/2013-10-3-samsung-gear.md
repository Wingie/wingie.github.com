[Seriously?](http://developer.samsung.com/forum/board/thread/view.do?boardName=General&messageId=243848)

You can't tell me you arent going to give me an SDK. That's the main reason i (and most other developers) left .net for the wonderfull world of open source php, python, ruby and maybe java. And i so wont recommend one to any of my friends untill you give me a developer SDK. (and maybe a free device but that's a bit too much.)

Samsung seems to bee taking it's cues from our dear old friend Microsoft whose annoyance [(and fiscal leeching](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/buy.aspx)) of 3rd party developers was known to be legendary. They seem to forget that it's developers who actually gave people a reason to buy products. Sorry, i could't hear you over the email that my iwatch buzzed gently though my bones into my ear.

If you ever wonder why Apple continues to sell phones at all at this point is very simple. It's the iOS developers. Apple has a vibrant marketplace because developers know that they will be well compensated for the time they spend on building an app. It's the best investment a developer can make. It's the developers who made people dependant on the iphones. By making the apps.

[I stumbled across this new york times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/technology/personaltech/samsung-watch-sinks-under-weight-of-its-features.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=technology&) that claimed that samsung's watch is an overhype and some other stuff. 

I can't wait to get my hands on it. I can always hope that samsung does release the kernel and things for the watch. Given enough time some developer would have gotten something working. It's android. It'll probably be a fun way to learn how to reverse engineer a driver. I have officially decided that that shall be a reason to buy myself one. 

I would love to build an arduino based sensors all around my house. IR sensors. Heat sensors. An automatic countown that sends me an email, text and siren based alarm whenever i put anything in my microwave. (most times if i'm alone at home i have to microwave thing twice). 

I've got legacy wiring in the walls that were laid down for wiring intercoms. It has officially become an I2C bus. All around my house. Room lighting based on if a person enters the room. check. (although technically the watch doesn't help in that scenario) Media request via audio input. 

But yeah. Let's hope and pray samsung doesn't go all like all sony on us. remember the days when being a PSP owner was an excercise in frustration for a developer. Yeah, ooh look at us we have a propriety cd format. And look at this amazing little storage that you can buy lots and lots of from us. but we don't sell them with games. You have to carry around a bunch of our proprietary "caseROMmod" CD storage device. Haha, you look silly now carrying all those things everywhere. Do you know what else we don't sell you.. a case for these things. And look at all these publishers who are not investing their time on the PSP platforms. Haha.

oh, and we wont also wont let you use the miniUSB port for anything. Not even as a wormlight. Even though the battery was the only good thing about this device. [we made our money. now you go home.](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/sony-psp-sales-tip-over-70-million-units-globally/50145)

Did it stop hackers? Not really. there was a hack that used a technique of the user scrolling through images of eggs. [maybe pictures of other things wouldn't make the PSP go all fuzzy and hand over kernel control to another program?](http://pspslimhacks.com/chickhen-mod-load-chickhen-smoother/) trust hackerz to do random things until something works.

Sony's updates to stop these enthusiast [were broken on day 0](http://www.slipperybrick.com/2007/01/psp-firmware-upgraded-cracked-on-same-day/). I think they just started hiring some of these guys instead and moved them to other projects. You really don't want to mess with japanese developers. No developers meant no new experiences on the PSP constantly to keep people locked in. People eventually forget about their devices unless they have their apps to give them solace.

So i will then get myself a watch in time. when the "innovation" has ended.

i wonder if i can 3D print a watch for myself. 

Screens can be managed but battery tech and assembly is the real problem.

*sigh*.. maybe the world isn't ready for wearable tech yet.

I'd sure love it to be though.
