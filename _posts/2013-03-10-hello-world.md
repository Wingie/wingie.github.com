##behold, a new blog has risen.

So this is going to be my first blog post. Hopefully one of many to come. It's been a while since i wrecked my wordpress blog so i'm kinda out of touch with this whole blogging thing now. Hopefully it'll be like riding a bike. Wordpress was like a bike that had plugins to turn the effing wheels into effing triangles. how the hell are you supposed to ride a bike with triangles for wheels? 

## the tools of the trade.

I gave up on wordpress long ago. Didn't think that the effort of resurrecting my blog was worth the pain of seeing in crashing down in flames again.
In fact the only reason i decided to blog again was because I discovered [this blog from whence my inspiration cometh from](http://marcocarag.com/). 
I was completely blown away and impressed by that chaps blog. That blog was hosted on github pages! I had dismissed Jekyll before (because i never liked how most of the blogs built on it looked)

1. [Jekyll](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) turned out to be a pretty cool platform that you can blog on. Once you get the hang of it its very bloody intuitive!

2. I could use [Vim](https://github.com/csexton/jekyll.vim) to write my blog posts! :D and i could use [sublime](https://github.com/dnfehren/SublimeJekyll) if i wanted too..

3. MarkDown is much more awesome than markup. and screw all the front end designers who would dare say otherwise. bloody `<p> tags </p>` .

4. Keeping my blog under version control via Git. can i get an amen, brother?

Being able to run `jekyll --server` and preview how my posts would look locally before i commit and push changes to github actually makes me feel that i'd blog more often.

i `<3` blogging from terminal.
