Asimov's true genius lies in the connections that he builds between his novels. And the surprising thing is if you look through the publication dates of the novels, half of his novels were written in the 1940s and the rest after a 20 year hiatus during the 1980s. And yet, there is no sense of discontinuity or anachronism, no feeling that things were adjusted later to cater to the connection that he was building between his novels (i'm looking at you Lucas). In fact, in looking at `"Author's Note" (pages ix to x) of "Prelude To Foundation"` asimov specifically claims that the `series` if you will was an ad-hoc creation and wasn't planned in any way.

This is not a definitive guide to his books and the post `may contain spoilers`. But if you haven't read Asimov's works yet, i doubt it would matter to you. 

## From Eternity to Infinity

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765319195/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0765319195&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=include02-20">The End of Eternity</a>
  is a relatively short novel written in 1955 and would most probably be a little tricky to find in a bookstore. That being said, I believe this novel marks the beginning of Asimov's universe. 
In a nutshell, the book describes a world ruled by time travelers or Eternals who have the technology to travel through time and do some sort of controlled reality modifications. They use their powers for good, and do pretty cool stuff like move resources from one point in history to another, but only after the technicians carefully evaluate the risks and potential changes that it can do to the time stream. 
The plot in the story however, explores an ontological paradox where the protagonist realizes that his current assignment is to go back in time and give the technology for time travel itself to the scientist who supposedly discovers it. [plot spoilers notwithstandingg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Eternity), the discovery`(?)` of  Time Travel however means that the technology for space travel would never be developed and thus humanity is stuck for eternity on this hell hole of a planet. (Earth).
The novel ends with the protagonist changing history by inciting the discovery of the neutron rather than the temporal time travel tech. This causes a cataclysmic reversal of the entire timeline wiping out the entire universe of the novel `(even the protagonist?)` and paving the way for a future when humanity can spread through the galaxy. Suspiciously similar to the rest of Asimov's works. (Asimov himself would probably disagree, but he's dead now...)

## The Age of Robots 
<div style="float: right" markdown="1">

</div>

Asimov's robot novels are legendary and any sci-fi fan worth his hyperstatial reactor should have read at least a few of the short stories. [The complete Robot](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038541627X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=038541627X&linkCode=as2&tag=include02-20) is a collection of short stories that you can get started on in case you are one of the poor souls who hasn't read it yet.
 
What's more intriguing is the technology that Asimov creates his Robots out of. To have developed such an accurate description during the 1940-50s (when color TV's were just beginning to bedazzle american consumers) is all the more intriguing.

Asimov's Robots are a perfect example of an Analogue Von-Neumann architechture. Their brains (what we would call CPU+memory) are constructed of a solid block containing just [positronic pathways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positronic_brain). During Asimov's time there was a general dissension on describing electrical flows through a circuit. (Electrons move from the negative terminal to the positive terminal by nature of their charge, but people found it more convenient to assume that electrical current moves from positive to negative terminal). The potential on these positronic pathway's are the "processing" capabilities of the robot.

The positronic pathways are technically hardcoded and influence the robot in any decisions that it should make. The famous 3 laws of robotics for example are fundamental in every decision that the robot makes and It's hardcoded nature make it impossible for the robot to break them in any way. One would spot the issue in this architecture however, if all instructions are hardcoded, how does the Robot "learn"? Asimov's robot's do not (technically). But if you think of the Robot's brain as a 3D FPGA neural network array, (so the robot can manipulate it's pathways to an extent) then a measure of controlled learning happens (but in the more advanced robots.) 

Most robots in the early years are usually specialized and are designed for a secific task. The construction of said pathways is an intense mathematical calculation and has produced robots that can read minds (Liar!), produce awesome creative pieces of artwork as well as marvelous feats of intuitive engineering.

[U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USRobotics) was the sole company that manufactured/designed and researched on the above robots. Obviously, you can't just sell the robot's to unsuspecting civilians. USRobotics didn't sell a single fucking robot however, they were all leased to the general public.  This allowed the company to confiscate / upgrade robots as they pleased. (They didn't have OTA updates then.)

An exception to his general rules appears in the "Bicentinnal Man", where a robot slowly gets the right to upgrade himself (enter lawyers) and moves on to be declared a human, ending with his voluntary natural death. Robin Williams acts in the movie and its seriously worth a watch.

</div>

In the robot novels, Asimov introduces [Susan Calvin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Calvin). (see movie shot above) The world's most awesome (and only) robot psychologist. She appears first observing a kid interacting with an UNIVAC computer in a short story that i do not remember. Her character progression (albeit only in short stories) is seriously awesome.

Robots are never truly accepted by the earth's population and are always seen with suspicion. Asimov drives on the "frankenstein" complex of humanity even with the framework of his 3 laws and soon robots are outlawed on earth and US mechanical men corp goes bankrupt because of government regulations. (that would never have happened had asimov been alive to see the power of banks.)

Robot are then used solely in out of earth operation such as automated asteriod mining camps and microwave energy beaming space stations off mercury's orbit (to satisfy Earth's power requirements.) 

This age ends with the discovery of Hyperspatial travel as humanity starts a wave of planetary colonization.

## Space, the final frontier.

[Hyperspatial Jumps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_(science_fiction)). A way to travel faster than light itself. Plenty of author's don't go into the technical details of how their hyperspatial engine works, leaving it to the readers imagination. Not Asimov, he gives a clear and concise description of the mathematical fundamentals behind his method of FTL. (albeit sparsely and spread out throughout his novels). In a sentence, its not really "travelling". Basically hyperspace is a mathematical abstraction where the entire galaxy plus the ship is reduced to a point. When you come out of hyperspace, you can decide where you want to end up. Make the wrong calculations, and you could end up inside a star. (the randomness inherent also means that you can end up inside a star, even if you make the correct calculations.)

The early days of hyperspatial travel are fraught with complications, Gravity (what we would call now the warping of space-time) affects the mathematical calculations necessary for travel and as distance increases so does the error range of where you would end up (Quantum Uncertainty). Early travellers could take months to move out of the range of large Gravitational objects to attempt a hyperspatial jump. Even with computing technology, the complexity of the calculations involves. (as it has to include any and all gravitational objects in the near vicinity of where you are and where you want to end up.)

Because of the risks and dangers inherent in early hyperspatial travel, only 50 planets were colonized in the initial wave. Earth's climatic / political deterioration made further colonies uneconomically feasible as the colonies could not help their mother planet much. This leads to a separation between the colonies and Earth.

## The Age of Spacers.

A lot of time has now passed. Hyperspatial technology has now improved but the technology is now in the hands of the spacers. The spacers are the in habitants of the 50 original colonies. The humans in those colonies have significantly diverged genetically from their ancestors on planet Earth. They live for 300-400 years and reject their ancestry to the earthlings. The spaces have no concepts of germs or diseases on their home planets and thus cannot return to Earth because their immune systems aren't accustomed to the variety of microbial life on earth. They fear the short lived earthlings and do not allow the inhabitants of their ancestral home to colonize other planets. Kinda like an economic barricade.

Earth is now a very different place. In "[The Caves of Steel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553293400/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0553293400&linkCode=as2&tag=include02-20)", Asimov describes a planet filled not with nations but mega-cities. People on earth fear the open sky and are accustomed to living under a controlled dome at all times. 

In "The Naked Sun" and "[The Robots of Dawn](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553299492/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0553299492&linkCode=as2&tag=include02-20)", Asimov describes life in two of the spacer planets. Aurora, planet of the dawn, named so because it is the first planet colonized and is thus seen as the capital of the spacer worlds. and Solaria, the last planet to be colonized and started off pretty much like a pleasure resort some of the more vain spacers. Solaria is full of wierdo's. They believe in complete and absolute freedom and give each individual hectares and hectares of land that he and only he lives on. The solarians have regressed to the point where meeting each other has become a phobia. (even for sex!)

<div style="float: right" markdown="1">
![alt text](/images/caves_steel.jpg "Daneel and Elijah Bailey")
</div>

In both these novels, we see an earthling ([Elijah Bailey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Baley)) tasked with the rather insurmountable problem of solving a crime on each of the spacer worlds. For the Why and How, you should really read the books :P.

The stage is being set for Earth to break free of the spacer blockade. The spacers are now comfortable in their world and do not wish to risk their long and comfortable lives in colonization other planets. But political powers on the spacer worlds do not wish to see the galaxy fall to the short lived earthling simply because there are so many of them. In the end, (expected really) because of the acts of said earth hero Elijah Bailey, Earth is allowed to colonize other planets. 

## The Robotic Duo: Daneel and Giskard

[Daneel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daneel) appears in the all three novels as an advanced humaniform robot. Unique even among the robot crazy spacers, he is (unlike other metal robots) completely humanlike in appearance. He and Elijah become friends in the course of the novels. 
Giskard appears in the "Robots of Dawn" as Daneel's friend. Asimov really does well in giving both these robots a personality.

Both these robots play a crucial role in shaping the future of Asimov's universe. Giskard has the unique ability to read and influence human emotions. Although since he is a robot, he is bound by the laws of robotics and can't influence humans in as much was as a reader would like.

"[Robots and Empire](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0586062009/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0586062009&linkCode=as2&tag=include02-20)" explores the travels of both these Robots along with their spacer mistress romping around with a earth trader. About 200 years have passed since "settlers" from from have started colonization and a kind of stand off has been reached to between the spacers and the settlers.

[Giskard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giskard#R._Giskard_Reventlov) is probably the only robot that ever dares to consider breaking the first law of robotics. `A robot shall never harm a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm`. The setting is fitting, a spacer plot to increase the latent radioactivity of earth to slowly make the planet uninhabitable for humans. When Both these robots confront the spacer, they are helpless (obviously) in the face of the first law. Giskard (although a little too late) kills the spacer responsible and does so by envisioning a higher law. 

The Zeroth law of robotics. `A robot shall never attempt to harm humanity or through inaction allow humanity to come to harm.` Giskard doesn't survive the encounter but through his mind altering abilities, imprints the Zeroth law in all its glory to Daneel and urges him to become the guardian of humanity. 

## And the Galactic Empire Rises

</div>
Time passes, the spacer worlds are forgotten (as they refrain from trade relations with the settlers worlds.) The freaking exponential increase of settler words leads to eventual colonization of the entire Galaxy. 
Humans being humans, crave organization and bureaucracy and above all, a strong military to keep the peace. And thus the Galactic Empire was born. 

Modeled upon imperial lines, The capital of the Empire was a planet called "[Trantor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor)". It was an entire planet that simply catered to the administration of the hundred million worlds (or so) making up the empire. [Pebble in the Sky](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765319136/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0765319136&linkCode=as2&tag=include02-20), T[he Stars, Like Dust](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765319152/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0765319152&linkCode=as2&tag=include02-20) and [The Currents of Space](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IK9F5O/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004IK9F5O&linkCode=as2&tag=include02-20) are some of his novels set in the Galactic Empire Era. You can look through them to gain a better understanding of Asimov's world as the Galactic Empire s

## and we're done for today.

The first half of Asimov's universe draws to a close here. (and this post has become long enough..) 
I'll complete the rest of Asimov's history lesson in another post.

cheers.
